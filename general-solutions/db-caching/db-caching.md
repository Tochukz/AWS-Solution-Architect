# DB Caching

## Requirement

A mobile gaming company is experiencing heavy read traffic to its Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database that retrieves playerâ€™s scores and stats. The company is using an Amazon RDS database instance type that is not cost-effective for their budget. The company would like to implement a strategy to deal with the high volume of read traffic, reduce latency, and also downsize the instance size to cut costs.

## Solution

Setup Amazon ElastiCache in front of Amazon RDS

## Operation

```bash
$ cfn-lint DbCaching.yaml
```

$ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file DbCaching.yaml --stack-name DbCaching
```

**After Deployment**

**Clean up**  

Delete the stack

$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name DbCaching
```
