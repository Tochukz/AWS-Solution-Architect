# Query S3 ALB Access Logs with Athena - HOL-209

### Description

The configuration sets up an Application Load Balancer with access logs to a S3 bucket.

We then use Athena to query the access logs in the S3 bucket.

### Operation

**Before deployment**

**Deployment**

Lint the template

```bash
$ cfn-lint Athena.yaml
```

Deploy the stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file Athena.yaml --stack-name Athena --parameter-overrides file://private-parameters.json
```

**After deployment**

1. Get the `LoadBalancerDnsName` from the stack output

```bash
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Athena --query "Stacks[0].Outputs" --no-cli-pager
```

2. Confirm that the test log file (`/AWSLogs/123456789/ELBAccessLogTestFile`) was created in the bucket by the ELB service.

**Testing**

1. Use the `LoadBalancerDnsName` to visit the application, fresh the page multiple time to create access logs
2. Wait for a few minutes then confirm that the access log directory (`/AWSLogs/123456789/elasticloadbalancing/eu-west-2`) was created in your logs bucket
3. Drill down to a log file and download it to take a look.
4. Go to the Athena Console > Query Editor > Settings Tab, and setup a query result bucket if it has not already been setup.
5. Run the _Create table_ query on Athena editor see `athena-queries.sql`
   <!--@todo: this is not working at the moment - error in SQL query-->
6. Run the other Queries to search the access logs.
<!-- This step depends on the success of step5 -->

**Cleanup**  
 Empty the S3 bucket

```bash
$ aws s3 rm s3://alb-access-logs-14-05 --recursive
```

To delete the stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name Athena
```
