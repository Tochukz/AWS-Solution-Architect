# S3 Permissions and Bucket Policies - HOL-105

### Description

This configuration demonstrates how permission can be granted to carry out operations on an S3 bucket using identity bases policies or resource based policy (bucket policy in this case).

Here we attach an inline policy to an already existing user with the username specified by the `RegularUser` parameter.  
The `RegularUser` will be permitted to upload and download files from the S3 bucket.

We also create a bucket policy that which permitts a second user with the username specified by the `AdminUser` parameter.  
The `AdminUser` will only be permitted to delete objects from the S3 bucket.

### Operation

**Before deployment**

**Deployment**

Lint the templates

```bash
$ cfn-lint BucketPermission.yaml
```

Deploy the BucketPermission stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file BucketPermission.yaml --stack-name BucketPermission --parameter-overrides file://private-parameters.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

**After deployment**

**Testing**

1. Copy a file to the bucket using the user specified by the `RegularUser` parameter

```bash
$ aws s3 cp cloud.png s3://simple-bucket-02-06 --profile john
```

2. Download the file also using the `RegularUser`

```bash
$ aws s3 cp s3://simple-bucket-02-06/cloud.png cloud-copy.png --profile john
```

3. Try deleting to the file using the `RegularUser`

```bash
$ aws s3 rm s3://simple-bucket-02-06/cloud.png --profile john
```

The delete operation should fail because the identity policy for `RegularUser` does not permit `s3:DeleteObject`.

4. Now try deleting the file again using the `AdminUser`

```bash
$ aws s3 rm s3://simple-bucket-02-06/cloud.png --profile peter
```

This should work now because the `AdminUser` is permitted to `s3:DeleteObject` in the bucket policy.

**Debug Errors**  
In the case of error during deployment

```bash
$ aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name BucketPermission > events.json
```

**Cleanup**
Empty the bucket

```bash
$ aws s3 rm s3://simple-bucket-02-06 --recursive
```

To delete the stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name BucketPermission
```
