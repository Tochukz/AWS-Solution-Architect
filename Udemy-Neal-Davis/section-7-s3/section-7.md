# Section 7: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

### IAM Policies, Bucket Policies and ACLs
__IAM Policies__  
* IAM policies are identity-based policies
* Specify what actions are allowed on what AWS resource
* If the policy document does not have _principal_ element in it, then it is likely an IAM policy

__Bucket Policies__  
* Bucket Policies are resource-bases policies
* Can only be attached to Amazon S3 buckets
* Also use the AWS access policy language

__S3 Access Control List (ACLs)__  
* Legacy access control mechanism that predates IAM
* AWS generally recommends using S3 bucket policies or IAM policies rather than ACLs
* Can be attached to a bucket or directly to an object
* Limited options for grantees and permissions

### Multipart Uploads and Transfer Acceleration
__Multipart Uploads__
* Performed using the S3 Multipart upload API
* It is recommended for objects of 100MB or larger
* Can be used for objects from 5MB up to 5TB
* Must be used for objects larger then 5GB

__S3 Transfer Acceleration__  
* Uses CloudFront edge locations to improve performance of transfer from client to S3 bucket

### MFA with S3
__S3 Multi-Factor Authentication Delete (MFA)__  
* Adds MFA requirement for bucket owners to do the following operations
  - Changing the versioning state of a bucket
  - Permanently deleting an object version
* The `x-amz-mfa` request header must be included in the above requests
* The second factor is a token generated by a hardware device or software program.
* __Versioning__ can be enables by
 - Bucket owner (root account)
 - AWS account that created the bucket
 - Authorized IAM users
* __MFA delete__ can be enabled by
 - Bucket owner (root account) only

__MFA-Protected API Access__  
* Used to enforce another authentication factor (MFA code) when accessing AWS resources (not just S3)
* Enforces using the `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` key in a bucket policy
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "123",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/securedocuments/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Null": {
          "aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### S3 Performance Optimization
__Design Patterns for Optimizing S3 Performance__  
* S3 automatically cales to high request rates wuth at least (per prefix):
  - 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE request per second
  - 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second
* Can increase read and write performance by using parallelization across _multiple prefixes_.  
* To increase uploads over long distance, use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration
* Byte-Range fetches use the _Range_ HTTP header to transfer only specified byte-range from an object
* Combine S3 and EC2 in the same AWS Region
* Use the latest version of the AWS SDKs
* Use caching services to cache the latest content:
  - Amazon CloudFront (CDN)
  - Amazon ElastiCache (in-memory cache)
* Horizontally scale requests across S3 endpoints
* [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html)  

### S3 Select and Glacier Select
__S3 Select__ and __Glacier Select__ are _SQL expressions_  that can be used to retrieve an object within a larger object.   
For example, you can retrieve a single file from a zip archive using the SQL expression.

## Amazon Glacier
__Things to note__  
* There is a charge if you delete data within 90 days â€“
* Retrieved data is available for 24 hours by default (can be changed)
* Amazon Glacier must complete a job before you can get its output
* Glacier automatically encrypts data at rest using AES 256 symmetric keys and supports secure transfer of data over SSL
* Retrieved data will not be encrypted if it was uploaded unencrypted
* You do not need an MFA device to access the retrieved files
